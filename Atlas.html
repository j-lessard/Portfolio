            This Atlas is the final product from my internship with the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership (CBEP). It grew out of CBEP's need to learn exactly which streams fed into Casco Bay, with the ultimate goal of identifying streams in the Casco Bay watershed that had significant impediments to fish passage and may therefore require special attention from the respective towns in which those streams reside. Also of interest to CBEP was the overall health of the stream, as determined from the disposition of landcover in the watershed and along the stream itself. Ultimately, the Atlas is meant to serve as a high-level view of each stream and a starting off point for discussions regarding those streams.   
            <br>
            <br>
            To that end, each stream was first identified using a combination of the National Hydrography dataset and orthoimagery. Once identified and where necessary, the streams were digitized and coded with basic information regarding stream name (where known) and town. Watersheds were then colated, either via the NHD or created through the watershed tool workflow, and used as the bounds for landcover analysis. Using the Maine Landcover Dataset, landcover categories for the watershed and along a 200-ft buffer of the stream were determined. Stream barriers were then gathered using the Maine Stream Habitat Viewer.

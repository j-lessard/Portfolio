                This a site selection lab from my GIS 1 class. We were tasked to identify locations in the Greater Portland area that could be used as recreational land. Conceptually, ideal recreation land would be land that is close to water to allow for swimming or fishing, near enough to schools or population centers to ensure frequent use, it must be accessible by road, and it must currently have appropriate landcover. For the purposes of this project, sites must be within 200 meters of a river, lake, or pond; 500 meters of a school or population center (determined to be areas with a population density of 1,000 or more per square kilometer); 1,000 meters of a secondary road; and the landcover must be  either forests, shrubs, or woody wetlands.  
                <br>
                <br>
                The resulting output shows that, while this area is one of the most densely populated areas in the state, there are many viable spots for future recreational areas. It should be noted, however, that this analysis does not filter out land currently in use as recreational land. Rather, it serves as a beginning point for further investigations.

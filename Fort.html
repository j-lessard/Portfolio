            This project is the end product from my Digital Mapping Applications class. We were tasked with creating a map that focused on Fort Williams park in Scarborough, Maine and incorporated a variety of GIS techniques. I wanted to explore the history of the Fort as it was in 1935, when it was still an active military installation. Few buildings from that period remain so I decided to recreate them as best I could. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Using photographs from that time period in conjunction with a building plan of the base, I digitized the building footprints and draped them over a DEM derived from LiDAR point cloud data. I then moved the files into ArcScene and added height data to the buildings, allowing them to be viewed in 3-dimensions. The height for each building is somewhat arbitrary, unfortunately. I could not locate actual height information and therefore used photographs to classify the buildings as either one, two, or three stories. I then used the average height for a typical building of similar stories to determine a z-score. Finally, I symbolized the DEM in a manner that encourages the viewer to see the map as a more natural recreation of what the Fort looked like.
